# Privacy Policy - Print(Notes)

**Last Updated: Nov 23, 2024**

Your privacy is important, so Print(Notes) does not collect, store, or share any data. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles your information and internet usage.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not:

- Collect or store any user data.
- Use analytics or tracking tools.
- Access or process your personal information.

## Local Data Storage

All notes and content you create in the app are <u>stored locally on your device</u>. The app does not send, upload, or back up this data to any external servers. You are fully in control of your notes and responsible for managing them.

## Internet Usage

The app may request internet access solely for the purpose of:

- Loading images or other embedded content from external URLs when rendered through Markdown or HTML.

No additional data is transmitted, collected, or stored during this process. Be aware that embedded content is subject to the privacy policies of the external websites being accessed.

## Third-Party Services

When embedding content from external websites (e.g., images, videos, or links), the privacy policies of those websites apply. The app does not interact with or process any of that content beyond retrieving and displaying it for you.

If the app integrates with third-party services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for syncing, their privacy policies govern how your data is handled on their platforms. Be sure to review their policies before using such features, if and when they get added.

## Your Rights

As this app does not collect any personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. You are in complete control of your locally stored notes.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. The latest version will always be accessible on the projectâ€™s GitHub repository.
