## Compiling the app

<details close>
<summary>Tap to show/hide build instructions</summary>

Make sure you have a working flutter sdk setup. If not installed, go to [Install - Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and select your platform.

Be sure to disable signing on build.gradle or change keystore to sign the app.

Before you start building, run these commands:

```
$ flutter channel stable
```

```
$ flutter upgrade
```

After that, building is as simple as running these commands:

```
$ flutter pub get
```

```
$ flutter run lib/main.dart
```

```
$ flutter build <target>
```

## Targets available for flutter:

- `aar`: Build a repository containing an AAR and a POM file.
- `apk`: Build an Android APK file from app.
- `appbundle`: Build an Android App Bundle file from app.
- `bundle`: Build the Flutter assets directory from app.
- `web`: Build a web application bundle. **(Won't work because app needs device storage access)**

### Device host specific

In other words, compiling can only be done on device you are compiling for (ex: `app.exe` requires windows)

- `linux`: Build a Linux desktop application.
- `windows`: Build a Windows desktop application.
- `macos`: Build a MacOS desktop application.
  - `ipa`: Build an iOS App Store Package from app.

### Known issues with running app as linux application on Linux Mint

<details close>
<summary>Tap to see issue details</summary>

**<u>Note: This doesn't seem to affect other types of distros, or when running android emulator</u>**

Running as linux application on flutter version _3.24.0-3.24.3_ causes any **TextFields** to <u>slows down</u> or <u>crash</u> the app (ex. editing note, creating note/folder, searching, etc), best workaround currently is to switch to version [3.22.3 following this link](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/upgrade#switching-to-a-specific-flutter-version) and changing all `onPopInvokedWithResult` to just `onPopInvoked` as it doesn't exist in this version, if you are still having issues, try running `flutter clean` then `flutter run lib/main.dart` again, let me know if you have any other issues or need a step-by-step guide.
