## Compiling the app

<details close>
<summary>Tap to show/hide build instructions</summary>

Make sure you have a working flutter sdk setup. If not installed, go to [Install - Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and select your platform, and follow the instructions to make sure you have all the right dependencies installed.

Once you get everything installed, test to see you didn't miss anything:

```
flutter doctor -v
```

---

Be sure to disable signing on build.gradle or create your own keystore to [sign](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#sign-the-app) the app for android.

### Building Locally

To make sure you are running latest version of flutter, run these commands:

```
$ flutter channel stable
```

```
$ flutter upgrade
```

After that, building is as simple as running these commands:

> This is to grab app dependencies

```
$ flutter pub get
```

> This is to make sure app runs

```
$ flutter run lib/main.dart
```

> If you are unsure what target operating system, read further down

```
$ flutter build <target> --release
```

### Targets available for flutter:

- `apk`: Build an Android APK file from app.
- `appbundle`: Build an Android App Bundle file from app (used for Google Play Store).
- `aar`: Build a repository containing an AAR and a POM file.
- `bundle`: Build the Flutter assets directory from app.

### Device host specific

In other words, compiling can only be done on device you are compiling for (ex: an `.exe` requires windows)

- `linux`: Build a Linux desktop application.
- `windows`: Build a Windows desktop application.
- `macos`: Build a MacOS desktop application.
  - `ipa`: Build an iOS App Store Package from app.

### Building with Docker

If you have docker installed you can run my script to automatically build APKs, here is how to use them:

> change into scripts directory

```
cd scripts/
```

> allow script to be executable

```
chmod +x docker-build.sh
```

> run the script

```
./docker-build.sh
```

On completion you should have an `outputs/` folder with 4 apk files (app-release, app-arm64-v8a-release, app-armeabi-v7a-release, and app-x86_64-release)

### Known Issues with Developing/Running App as Linux Application on Linux Mint

<details close>
<summary>Tap to see issue details</summary>

**<u>Note: This doesn't seem to affect other types of distros, or when running in android emulator</u>**

Running as linux application on flutter version _3.24.0-3.24.3_ causes any **TextFields** to <u>slows down</u> or <u>crash</u> the app (ex. editing note, creating note/folder, searching, etc), best workaround currently is to switch to version [3.22.3 following this link](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/upgrade#switching-to-a-specific-flutter-version) and changing all `onPopInvokedWithResult` to just `onPopInvoked` as it doesn't exist in this version, if you are still having issues, try running `flutter clean` then `flutter run lib/main.dart` again, let me know if you have any other issues or need a step-by-step guide.
